            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello there, I am Ehsan, and I am a graduate student studing Electrical and Computer engineering at University of Tehran.
            If I want to write a few lines about myself, I have to start by stating that I am very fond of Artificial Intelligence.
            Because of this, I have studied and worked extensively in many realted fields such as Machine learning, Deep learning and 
            Reinforcement learning. Moreover, as optimization is realted to most of AI sub-sections, I have familiarized myself to
            Concepts like Linear and Non-Linear Optimization and Optimal Control. What is more, Related Control Theory and Algbera 
            theorems are at the core of designing a well-implemented intelligent system, which I have been in Contact with as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My reaserch is mostly focused on designing, creating, fine-tuning and exploring end-to-end Intelligent systems. 
            Some of the research I have done are related to Vision Systems, Robot-grasping and Price Predition. These works will hopefully not 
            only pave a path towards studing and developing Artificial General Intelligence, but also help the Industry with a Multi-faced solution as well.
